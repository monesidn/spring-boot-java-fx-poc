A simple POC to show how to integrate spring boot with JavaFX. 

Based on: 
<https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot-a-javafx-spring-boot-application/>

The greatest advantage of this approach is the ability to use DI into controllers and handle them as singleton or prototype using standard spring annotations.

I intentionally left out the event management as it may be an overshoot for simple projects. It can be easily integrated anyway.
